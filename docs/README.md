## Website Summary
This builds off of a basic [Start Boostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) template.

It's a static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket.

## Run Locally
In your terminal under this root website folder type: `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html` to open up the index page on your local host.

## Edit
All of the written content is under `index.html`. Add content there.

The `css/style.css` file contains all of the custom overwrites to the starter template.

Add any screenshots or images into the `images` folder.
